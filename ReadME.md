# Project Overview

## Goals
- To understand how to categorize YouTube videos based on comments and stylistic factors.
- To determine the factors affecting the popularity of YouTube videos.
- To utilize AWS services for building a scalable data pipeline and analytics platform.

## Tools and Technologies
- **AWS S3**: To store and retrieve data.
- **AWS Glue**: For ETL jobs and data cataloging.
- **AWS Lambda**: For running code in response to triggers.
- **Amazon Athena**: For querying data using SQL.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: For visualizing and analyzing data.
- **AWS IAM**: For managing access to AWS services securely.

## Expected Outcomes
- A scalable ETL pipeline that can handle data from multiple sources.
- A data lake on AWS S3 for organized data storage.
- A data analytics platform that uses Athena and QuickSight for insights.

# Detailed Steps

## Step 1: Set Up AWS Environment
1. Create an AWS account.
2. Set up IAM users and groups for secure access management.
3. Install and configure AWS CLI on your local machine.

## Step 2: Data Collection and Storage
1. Download the YouTube dataset from Kaggle.
2. Create S3 buckets for raw and processed data.
3. Upload the raw data to the S3 bucket using AWS CLI.

## Step 3: Build the ETL Pipeline
1. Use AWS Glue to create crawlers for extracting data schemas.
2. Develop Glue ETL scripts to transform raw data into a structured format.
3. Set up Glue jobs to automate the ETL process.

## Step 4: Data Analysis and Querying
1. Set up Athena to run SQL queries against your data in S3.
2. Analyze data to identify trends and insights about YouTube video popularity.

## Step 5: Reporting and Visualization
1. Set up Amazon QuickSight for data visualization.
2. Create dashboards to represent data insights effectively.
3. Share dashboards with stakeholders for decision-making.

## Step 6: Optimization and Automation
1. Implement Lambda functions to automate data processing tasks.
2. Optimize the data model and queries for performance.
3. Automate regular reports and alerts using SNS.

## Step 7: Security and Compliance
1. Ensure that data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
2. Implement least privilege access policies in IAM.
3. Regularly audit the environment for security compliance.

## Step 8: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. Monitor AWS resources using CloudWatch.
2. Set up alerts for any operational issues.
3. Regularly update and patch AWS resources.

## Step 9: Documentation and Support
1. Document the architecture, configuration, and operational procedures.
2. Prepare user manuals and troubleshooting guides.
3. Provide training sessions for end-users.
